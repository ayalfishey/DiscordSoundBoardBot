# DiscordSoundBoardBot

You can edit the Config file to add sound clip folder, google drive folder and bot token or you can run the application and it will prompt you to input them.

the bot will prompt you for permission to your google drive. this is so you can set up a folder and share it with other people who can add their own sound clips. Be carefull who you share it with!! the bot will automaticly download the missing content of that folder to your pc.

make sure when you set the sound clip path to end with a file seperator eg: C:\soundclips\
make sure when you set the google drive folder name to pay attention to Casing eg: if your folder is named SoundClips dont input soundclips

You will need to generate your own discord bot token
